Sometimes you just need a simple module to make sure things are working. For example:

- Is npm (or your npm mirror) available?
- Are files getting written to disk?
- Is literally anything in this house of cards we call technology working as intended?

idk, whatev!

It's just a dummy CJS + ESM that doesn't do anything useful.
