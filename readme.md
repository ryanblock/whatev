# `whatev`

## Sometimes you just need a simple module to make sure things are working.

For example:

- Is npm (or your npm mirror) available?
- Are module files getting written to disk?
- Is literally anything in this house of cards we call technology working as intended?

idk, `whatev`: dummy CJS + ESM that merely exists. ðŸ’•
